SpringWebApp v2
===============

A boiler-plate template project for Eclipse that demonstrates a typical Spring-based J2E webapp.

## Development Environment
* Windows 7
* Spring Tool Suite 3.4.0
* JDK 1.7.0_03-b05
* Tomcat 7.0.30
* MySql 5.6.7-rc

## Core APIs
* Spring MVC 3.2.6
* Apache Shiro Security 1.2.2
* Servlet 3.1
* JSP 2.2.1
* Tiles 3.0.3
* Hibernate 3.5.4

The intention is to evolve this boiler-plate over time.  The project really serves as a way of 
keeping myself up to date with building websites using the newest Java/J2EE technologies.  The 
main goal is to provide a reusable framework that can be used as baseline for new J2EE based websites.
